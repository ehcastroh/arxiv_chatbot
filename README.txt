# ArXiv Chatbot

## Overview

This project implements a chatbot system with integrated tool definitions and execution.
The chatbot is designed as a simple but extensible example for understanding how conversational AI can be augmented with tools, via model context protocol (MCP) to perform tasks beyond basic dialogue.

## Features

* **Tool Definitions:** Functions that the chatbot can call to perform specific actions.

* **Tool Execution:** A mechanism that routes user requests to the correct tool.

* **Chatbot Core:** Handles user input, determines intent, and decides whether to respond directly or invoke a tool.

* **Interactive Demo:** A conversational interface where you can chat with the bot.
